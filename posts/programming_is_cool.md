### Programming is cool

In this post, I'll be talking about my take on programming, and why I think it's a cool thing
to learn and to do.

To start, first I'd like to dig a bit deeper to the word programming.

#### What is programming?

So programming is kind of like configuring a computer to do what you want it to do. It's not much
different than when you program your washing machine for example to match the type of clothes
you're intending to wash.

Except for the level of flexibility your washing machine gives you, for example, you can't
program your washing machine to provide the information about how dry the clothes already are
to your dryer (or can you?).

But when it comes to computers, they're designed for flexibility and general-purpose usage.
Therefore, you need more than just configuring them to do what you want, you should 
tell them in their own *language*. To do that, you'll use a *programming language*.

So a programmer, is a person, savvy in speaking the language of the computer, enough
to make it do specific tasks.

Can anyone learn how to program? Absolutely. Why won't they? Maybe it's just a matter of time.
Already many teenagers learn how to program in their high school or even before, and programming
languages evolve to be more accessible and more capable.

It's not even very hard to imagine, one day a machine programs another machine.

#### Then programming is not a superpower?

Are programmers people with special abilities?  Well depends on the number of people with the
same skills, if there aren't enough of them and you're one of them, you're certainly special,
but not forever.

In other words, if you're interested in programming just because it makes you look cool and
special, by all means, go for it. It's worth learning, even if you become less special after
a few years, you still learned an enabling skill that can help to make your life much better.

#### Wait, I'm already a programmer, so what's your point?

My point is that you're definitely special, but not because you know
how to talk to computers and most people don't, and may never will, but because you're
already aware of the endless possibilities.

That's a skill that may someday, well within your lifetime, be acquired by a machine and
that may make you question your decision to become a programmer.

But don't be discouraged at all, you're probably an expert in a field that can improve the
lives of human beings for the better. And the more knowledge and experience you get, the more
possibilities open to you.

#### I'm not a programmer, how hard is it to become one?

If you know how to use a calculator, you're already a programmer, okay maybe not in a very
general-purpose way. But you're already close to learning your first general-purpose
programming language.

Most people that become curious and learn their first programming language, are not actually
interested in the programming language itself, but they may want to know how something
they were fascinated about was built, maybe they wanted to build one of their own, or change
it to match their fantasies.

Many of great programmers I know became programmers because of their field of interest
introduced them to programming. Fields like: robotics, game development, simulation
software in physics and biology, and mathematical software are such examples.

People fascinated about those things tend to be interested in learning programming, because
it gives them more power and control over what they want to do with their ideas.

A vast number of people also learn to program because it was probably a good or the only way
for them to start making money, by learning a skill in a relatively short amount of time.

Either way, once you learn how to talk to a computer, you can harness its powers and use it
for solving real-world problems and making something cool.

There are very few people that actually like programming for the sake of programming itself,
after all, we like to make a connection with real life and our fantasies.

#### A few words about software development

A software, to be used in real-life situations usually have to deal with a lot of complexities.
When you want to tell the computer how to deal with different situations of a real-life problem
you realize that life, and in particular human interaction is not a simple thing to formulate
at all.

In fact, there's so much complexity involved that it's almost impossible to write a piece of
software that has anticipated all conditions and reacts to them accordingly.

Computer bugs (flaws in software) are more often result of not understanding the problem
correctly or completely, than not knowing how to translate them to a computer language.

Learning how to program is only the start, by learning a programming language, you know
how to talk to a computer. But in order to have useful software, you need to learn how to
deal with the other side too, the complexities of the real world and human interactions.

Learning how to deal with both sides, is a long process and requires many years of
studying, experimenting and learning.

I don't think in any foreseeable future, machines can become good software developers
because the list of skills required to achieve this, is long and much of it is overlapping
with thinking like a human being.

#### Conclusion

Programming gives you control over one of the most important and most powerful invention
of human beings, computers, and it's something that can change your life
forever, and for the better.

Specific tasks can be done by knowing a programming language and that already opens so
many doors to possibilities to build something useful.

But as fascinating they are, software programs are complex living creatures that demand constant
care and attention. Therefore the word *software development* is there to remind you that
if you want a long-lasting software that can be used in real-life situations, learning
how to program is only the start.

So hopefully you'll "take the red pill" and learn to build something that you always wanted
to have.
